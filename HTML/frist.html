		The Conservatives are confident David Cameron will remain PM with early general election results suggesting the party will be close to a majority.
		</p>

		<p>
			Labour has rejected an exit poll suggesting it would get 239 MPs to the Tories' 316.
		The same poll suggested the Lib Dems would lose 47 seats and the SNP would win all but one seat in Scotland.<br>
		Results so far suggest the exit poll is accurate but the majority of the 650 seats have yet to declare.
		In other election developments:
		</p>
		<p>
		The SNP are on course for a landslide in Scotland and could take all of the seats but one
		Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander have lost their seats to the SNP
		The Lib Dems are facing a wipeout and could end up with as few 10 MPs - a loss of 47
		Lib Dem cabinet minister Ed Davey has lost his Kingston and Surbiton seat to the Tories
