						<h2>What your coffee says about you</h2>
						<h4>The philosopher who studies the experience of coffee</h4>
					</header>
					<p>
						It’s like I’m drinking the dying embers of a log-fire – 
						smoky and tinged with the tang of creosote. 
						As I concentrate harder, I notice its smooth, 
						viscous texture that seems to mask a sharper undertone – 
						like a blade cloaked in velvet.
					</p>
					<p>
						I’ve never paid so much attention to a cup of coffee in my life. 
						I’m not sure I’ve grasped its secrets just yet. 
						But if I do, I’m told it might just offer me a 
						glimpse of some of the big questions in life.
					</p>
					<p>
						My guide on this journey is David Berman at Trinity 
						College Dublin – a philosopher who has spent many 
						hours studying the intricacies of the mind’s inner 
						working and the senses. Now he’s turned his attention 
						to his favourite drink, and the profound answers 
						that might be lurking at the bottom of our coffee cup. 
						The result will be a new book, The Philosophy of 
						Coffee-tasting.

						<h2>Little Miss Mozart</h2>
						<h4>Alma Deutscher and the five greatest child prodigies</h4>
					</header>
					<p>
						This week, I had the pleasure of interviewing Alma Deutscher. 
						A composer of piano and violin sonatas, string quartets and 
						lately a full-length opera, Deutscher also plays the violin 
						and piano superbly – and has recently turned ten. The British 
						girl is being described as 'Little Miss Mozart', not only 
						because of her precocious talents, but because of her inspirations, 
						namely: "Mozart, Schubert and Tchaikovsky - 
						the composers of the most beautiful melodies ever written."
					</p>
					<p>
						As a composer, Deutscher is brimming with charming melodies, 
						which often arrive unbidden and fully formed. "Even when I'm 
						trying to do something else, when people are talking to me 
						about something completely different, I get these beautiful 
						melodies that play inside my mind," she told me. "Sometimes 
						it might be a human voice singing, sometimes a piano, sometimes 
						a violin."

				<h3>The decision that changed art</h3>
				<p>
					In 1878 Van Gogh was a struggling would-be preacher. 
					At his lowest ebb, he began to draw. Alastair Sooke 
					looks back at this pivotal moment in history.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the spring of 1878, Vincent van Gogh turned 25. 
					As he looked back over his short life, 
					the Dutchman found little to celebrate 
					among the meagre endeavours of his faltering career. 
					By conventional, middle-class standards, he was a failure.
